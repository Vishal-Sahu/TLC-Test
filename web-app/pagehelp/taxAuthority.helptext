== Tax Authorities
=== Overview
* Create multiple tax authorities, if required
* Specify mandatory, optional or ad-hoc tax recording per authority
=== Description
Some countries, such as the UK, have a single tax authority (HMRC VAT) while other countries,
such as the US, have multiple tax authorities (each state is its own tax authority). Some
countries allow for cooperation between their tax authorities, such as the European Union. You
my create as many tax authorities as you need to represent these differing situations.

Each tax authority can individually specify, via its 'Usage' setting, how the invoices and
credit notes of any customer or supplier using of one of that authority's tax codes must be
treated. The usage options range from invoices and credit notes always having to specify the
tax code through to a completely ad-hoc use of the authority's tax codes.
[[
{{info}} Sometimes you may need to record purchases from suppliers even when those suppliers do not
charge you tax on their supplies. This is common with VAT style methods of taxation where invoices
from non-registered suppliers still need to be recorded for reporting purposes. In such cases you
may wish to create a special 'untaxed' code for such authorities to handle this situation.
