== Your Browser

=== Javascript
Your browser should have JavaScript enabled. Browsers usually have this enabled by default.

=== Locales
When you are on the home page of the system or are on the login or registration pages, what
language you see will depend upon two things: 1) What language translations we have available
and 2) The locale (i.e. language and country) setting of your browser. If you are unsure as to
whether the locale is set correctly in your browser, the following list may be useful for the
more popular browsers at the time of writing:

* **Microsoft Internet Explorer 10.** Under Tools, Internet Options click the Languages button on the General tab and set the language preference you require.
* **Mozilla Firefox 18.** Install the Quick Locale Switcher add-on and you can then quickly change between locales.
* **Google Chrome 25.** Click the menu button and select Settings. Click the 'Show advanced settings' link. Click the 'Languages and input settings' button. Choose the required language.
* **Opera 12.** Under Settings, Preferences the General tab has a drop down list of the languages available. On Apple computers you may need to download and install languages files instead.
* **Apple Safari 5.** There is currently no easy way to do this.

Once you are logged in to the system, however, the language and country settings of your user profile
take over the role of controlling formatting and text translations.

=== The Back Button
Our system is tolerant of you using the Back button on your browser but, nevertheless, it's usually
better to use the facilities of our software to navigate around the system.

=== Tabs and Windows
If you use multiple tabs within a browser window or multiple browser windows to access our system
you will, sooner or later, confuse yourself and, ultimately, the system - although no harm can be
done. The reason for this is that modern browsers when talking to a server use the same 'session'
for all tabs and all windows. Should you wish to have more than one session in to our system at the
same time, the only totally safe way is to use two (or more) different brands of browser. For example,
if you mainly use Microsoft Internet Explorer, also have Firefox available, or, if you use Firefox
try Chrome etc.
