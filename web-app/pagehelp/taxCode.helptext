== Tax Codes
=== Overview
* Create multiple tax codes per authority, if required
* Maintain a history of tax rates associated with each code
* Set new tax rates to take effect in the future
=== Description
Each tax code you create must be given a unique code throughout the company and
must 'belong' to a particular tax authority.
[[
{{info}} Sometimes you need to record purchases from suppliers even when those suppliers do not
charge you tax on their supplies. This is common with VAT style methods of taxation where invoices
from non-registered suppliers still need to be recorded for reporting purposes. In such cases you
may wish to create a special 'untaxed' code for such authorities to handle this situation. The rate
for such a tax code would be zero so that there is no tax value, but the goods value is still recorded.
]]
Each tax rate associated with a tax code has a start date and will remain in effect from that date
forward until another tax rate record is encountered for that code with a later start date, at which
point the later tax rate will be used whenever you allow the system to work out the tax for an invoice
or credit note line for you. Note that most tax authorities require you to enter the tax charged on,
say, a supplier invoice line //even when it has been incorrectly calculated//.
[[
{{exclaim}} Although you can create, edit and delete the tax rates associated with a tax code, be aware
that each transaction recorded within the system keeps a copy of of the goods and tax values at the
time it was entered and so will not be affected by any changes you make. Only subsequently entered
transactions may be affected.
