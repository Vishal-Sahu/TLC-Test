== Translation
=== Overview
* Specify the locale to translate messages to
* Select the locale to translate messages from
* Hierarchical retrieval of texts to be translated
* Display messages awaiting translation, already translated or both
* Further restrict messages to be translated using Criteria settings
* Automatically change multiple messages with matching source texts
=== Description
Localized message texts are looked up by the system in a hierarchical manner. For example,
if a user's profile is set to use the French Canadian locale (language code 'fr', country
code 'CA' giving a locale value of 'frCA') and the system is requested to display a piece
of localized text with a code of 'welcome', then the system will first of all look for a
message with a code of 'welcome' and a locale of 'frCA'. If no such message can be found, it
will then look for a message with a code of 'welcome' and a locale of 'fr'. If still no message
is found, it will look for a message with a code of 'welcome' and a locale of '*' where the '*'
means the default locale. The default locale of this system uses UK English texts as standard.

Typically, you would rely on this hierarchical search method to allow the system to pick the texts
closest to the locale you are translating to. However, consider a situation where you wish to translate
to Peruvian Spanish and translations have already been performed to both standard Spanish (as spoken
in Spain) and Columbian Spanish. If you know that the Columbian Spanish texts are closer to what you
want than the standard Spanish texts, you can set the From language to Spanish and the From Country to
Columbia to force the system to prefer Columbian Spanish texts over standard Spanish texts. Unless you
have checked the 'Strict' check box (described below) the system will still find the standard Spanish
texts in the event of a missing Columbian version (possibly missing because the Columbian version was
the same as the standard Spanish version and thus needed no Columbian specific translation).

[[
{{info}} When you are translating //to// a language that is the standard version of that language (e.g.
German as spoken in Germany) it is usually better to specify only the language to be translated to rather
than both the language //and// the country. This would allow another translator to build upon your standard
German texts, only having to translate the differences for, say, Austrian German.
]]

By default, when showing you message texts available for translation the system uses its hierarchical
method of finding the source text as described above. However, occasionally you might wish to see only
texts that strictly match the language (and probably country) setting you have specified as the 'from'
locale. You can achieve this by checking the 'Strict' check box in the Selectors page.

[[
{{info}} If you wish to translate to a country specific version of a language (e.g. to Peruvian Spanish) but no
translation to standard Spanish (as spoken in Spain) or any other dialect of that language has been done, then
the system will also insert your Peruvian Spanish text as the standard Spanish text since the system needs a
standard version of a text before it can add in the country specific version. Consequently, if you also intend
to do a translation to standard Spanish, it would be better to do that before doing the Peruvian Spanish variant.
]]

By default, the system will show you texts that have already been translated and texts still awaiting
translation so that you may review the status of your translations. Sometimes, however, you may wish to
see only texts that have already been translated or only texts which are still awaiting translation. You
may specify this by using the 'Display' setting in the Selectors page. In all cases, you can further limit
which messages are shown by using the Criteria facility on the Translation List screen.

There are many duplicate message texts within the system. This is not a mistake but is to allow flexibility.
For example, there are many messages in the default locale with a text of 'Name'. In specific, both Customer
and Supplier records have a name field. You may 'bulk update' texts (e.g. to translate //all// occurrences of
'Name' to, say, 'Nom' for a French language translation) by simply checking the Propagate check box on the Edit
page. You may also make bulk corrections and/or bulk deletions in the same manner.

[[
{{exclaim}} Messages with codes starting with 'default' or 'generic' are, as the code implies, used in many
situations. These messages usually have parameters (described below) and do not always fit in neatly with the
structure of languages other than English. For example, the message with a code of 'default.list.label' will,
when combined with another word such as 'Customer', produce text on the screen of 'Customer List' in English.
Unfortunately this does not translate well in to, say, French where the French equivalent of 'List of Customers'
would be more appropriate. Unfortunately, this would require the system to be able to pluralize the word for
Customer for all the different languages in the system. Such linguistic complexities are beyond the scope of
the system and so you must make the best of what we are able to practically offer.

Many message texts within the system use parameters. Parameters take the form of '{0}', '{1}', '{2}' and so forth. The
parameters (e.g. '{0}' etc.) need not be consecutively numbered within a message text and need not be used in numeric order.
Other words are used to replace these parameters when the message is to be displayed on the screen. For example,
the message with a code of 'default.created.message' has a text in the default locale of '{0} {1} created'. If
you create a new supplier record with an account code of '123456' then a message will appear on the screen of
'Supplier 123456 created.' Most of the time, what will be substituted for each parameter is fairly obvious but,
in the situations where the meaning of the parameters is //not// obvious, you can either ask your System Supervisor for
their meaning or try switching your profile to use English and find a place where the English version of the message
is displayed. The code of the message can help you to find where the message might be used. For example, the message
with a code of 'accessGroup.element.bad.data' is obviously something to do with the Access Group security facility
of the system and the definition of the Elements within an access group. In specific, the user appears to have entered
some invalid data in to an Element of an Access Group record.
