  Also, when auto creating element values, the name of the value will simply be set to the new code you entered for \
  that element.
account.status.help=Select whether this account is expected to normally be a debit or credit balance. This setting may \
  be used by reports to control what is displayed as a 'negative' value (i.e. opposite to what is specified here). It \
  is also used when importing budget figures in to the system where a positive budget figure is assumed to be of the \
  'sign' specified here. NOTE, however, that changing the status of an account will NOT change existing loaded budget \
  values. You must change them manually if this is your intention.

balanceReportLine.accumulation.help=If this line is to be an accumulated value then you may enter a comma separated list of Chart Section codes \
  and/or line numbers to accumulate here. The first character of the line must be either a plus sign (+) to signify that the total is expected \
  to be a Debit value or a minus sign (-) if the total is expected to be a Credit value. For example, an Accumulation of '+ fxdassets, 200' \
  specifies that a Chart Section with a code of 'fxdassets' is to be accumulated with the value of line number 200 of the report and that the \
  result is expected to be a Debit value. NOTE that irrespective of the numerals you enter in to the Line Number fields, the digits you enter \

  dates. If you select more source periods than target periods, the extra source periods will be ignored. If you select more target periods \
  than source periods, after 'using up' the source periods, the system will cycle around to the first source period again as its source of data.

budget.adjust.adjustmentType.label=Adjustment Type
budget.adjust.adjustmentType.help=You may set the target period budget values to an abosolute monetary value (in which case your source Year/Periods \
  and Source Data selections are ignored) or you may add/subtract a specified monetary amount to/from the source values to arrive \
  at the target budget values. Alternatively, you may choose to increase or decrease the source data by a percentage to arrive at the target budget \
  values. All monetary values should be entered in the company currency. To increase source values use positive adjustments and to decrease source \
  values use negative adjustments. 'Increase' and 'Decrease' are terms which are relative to the Status (Dr or Cr) of each account processed. If you \
  select 'none' as the adjustment type then you are simply performing a copy of the source values to the target values.
budget.adjust.adjustmentValue.label=Adjustment Value
budget.adjust.adjustmentValue.help=If you chose 'none' for the Adjustment Type, then leave this field blank. If you chose to adjust the source \
  values by a monetary amount, or to set the budget values to a specific monetary value, then enter the amount (in whole units of the company's \
  currency) here. If you chose to adjust the source values by a percentage then enter the percentage (excluding any percent sign) with up to \
  three decimal places that you would like to adjust the figures by. For example, entering a percentage of 50 would take the Source Data \
  value, uplift it by 50% and then set the resulting value as the new budget. Using a large enough negative percentage or monetary adjustment can \
  change a credit budget value to a debit budget value and vice versa, so be careful!

chartSection.segment1.no.ranges=Segment 1 cannot be blank as the segment has ranges
chartSection.segment.blank.inter=You may not leave intermediate segments blank
chartSection.default.excess=Segment {3} does not contain an element and therefore cannot have a default
chartSection.default.number=Segment {3} is the account number segment and cannot be given a default
chartSection.default.bad.default=The default for segment {3} does not match its element definition
chartSection.default.default.val=The default for segment {3} does not exist as a code element value
chartSection.pattern.no.number=One of the code segments must contain the account number element
chartSection.pattern.ambiguous=The segments contain two adjacent optional elements of the same length and data type. \
  The code structure is therefore ambiguous since, if only one segment was entered, the system would be unable to determine which \
  segment was being defaulted.
chartSection.path.bad=Invalid path
chartSection.path.levels=A path can only have nine levels
chartSection.path.help=The path is a dot delimited definition of where this chart section exists within the hierarchy of the \
  Chart of Accounts. A path such as 'revenue' is a top level section since it has no dot in it. A path such as revenue.sales \
  is a second level section where the code of the section is sales and it belongs to a parent with a code of revenue. Similarly, \
  a path such as revenue.sales.software is a third level section with a code of software and which belongs to the sales second \
  level section. Each section's code (i.e. that last - or only - portion of its path) must be unique within the company. Codes \
  may be up to 10 characters long, must begin with a letter which can then be followed by letters or digits, and can be nested \
  up to nine levels deep in the path. Changing the parent of a section by altering its path will also move all its children.
chartSection.code.help=The code of a chart section uniquely identifies that section within the overall Chart of Accounts.
chartSection.code.letter=The chart section's code must begin with a letter
chartSection.name.help=Enter a descriptive name for this chart section of up to 50 characters.
chartSection.sequencer.help=Within a parent section, child sections are ordered by a sequencer value which must be unique within that parent. \
  This is simply an integer (0..999999) that orders the children within their parent section. Similarly, for top level sections, the sequencer \
  value orders the top level sections within the chart as a whole. Within a section, accounts are listed in ascending order of their account codes.
chartSection.segments.help=There can be up to eight code segments within an overall account code. If you do not intend to create accounts \
  in this section, leave the segments blank. For sections intended to contain accounts (as opposed to just sub-sections), each segment used must be \
  one of the code elements you have defined, but you need not use all code elements and the segments need not be in the same \
  order as the code element numbers. You MUST include the 'account number' code element (element number 1) in one of your segments \
  since, using the ranges associated with a chart section, the 'account number' element identifies which chart section any particular account \
  belongs to.
chartSection.defaults.help=You can specify a default for a code segment which, from the end user's point of view when entering full \
  account codes, makes the segment optional. If they miss the segment out, the default value will be used. For example, if the last \
  segment of a full account code was a 'Cost Centre' segment defined as being three digits long, and you had defined a default on this \
  segment of 000 (meaning, say, Head Office), then if the end user did not enter the 'Cost Centre' segment, a value of 000 would be \
  used. You can not put a default on the segment that uses the 'account number' element.
chartSection.type.help=All Chart of Account sections must be marked as being either of Income and Expenditure (also know as \
  Profit and Loss) type or of Balance Sheet type. For all top level sections (i.e. ones with no parent section other than \
  the Chart of Accounts itself) you must select which type of section this is. For all child sections, since a child section \
  must be of the same type as its parent, you may as well leave this set to 'none' since no matter what you enter for a child section \
  it will always be set to the same type as its parent. Note that a chart section type affects what accounts may be placed within the \
  section. For example, you can't place a bank account in an Income and Expenditure section.
chartSection.autoCreate.help=For a section that can contain accounts (as opposed to just sub-sections), check this box to allow the system \
  to automatically create accounts within the section. If the box is un-checked, you will have to manually create all valid combinations of \
  account codes (account number, department code, project code etc) permitted in this section.
chartSection.status.help=Select whether accounts created in this section are expected to normally have debit or credit balances. \
  If this section is not intended to contain accounts, enter the expected state of the total of accounts within its sub-sections. \
  This setting may be used by reports to control what is displayed as a 'negative' value (i.e. opposite to what is specified here). \
  NOTE that changing the status of a chart section does not propagate down to its accounts or sub-sections. You must change these manually \
  if this is your intention.
chartSection.accounts.bad=The change of type would leave accounts in section {0} invalid
chartSection.child.bad=Unable to save child section {0}
chartSection.ranges.bad=The change of segments would leave the ranges for section {0} invalid
chartSection.default.bad=The default for segment {0} is not within the ranges for this section
chartSection.autoCreate.bad=The auto create flag cannot be set for a section that cannot contain accounts (i.e. segment 1 is blank)
chartSection.no.default=You cannot add a new code segment to an active section without supplying a default value to update its accounts with
chartSection.no.value={0} is not a valid default value
chartSection.range.save=Error saving the modified range records
chartSection.account.save=Error saving the modified account records
chartSection.print=Print Chart Of Accounts
chartSection.empty=The chart of accounts is empty

  Element 1 is special in that it must represent the 'account number' element where 'account number' is used to identify \
  which section of the Chart of Accounts the account belongs (Revenue, Fixed Assets etc). The 'account number' element \
  is typically numeric and is often around six digits long. Other element numbers need not be consecutive and can represent \
  any additional breakdowns of the 'account number' in to sub-accounts. Typical uses of these additional elements are to \
  break an account down by Cost Centre, Project and so forth.
codeElement.name.help=Enter a descriptive name for this code element of up to 30 characters.
codeElement.dataType.help=Select the data type for this code element. Numeric codes must use the digits 0 through 9. \

  a through z.
codeElement.dataLength.help=Select the length of the data for this code element, from 1 to 10. Code values for this \
  element must be exactly this length. For example, if you specify the data type as being numeric and the length as 3, \

companyUser.not.assigned=We are sorry, but you have still not been assigned to a company. Please contact your company administrator.
companyUser.assign.title=Company Assignment
companyUser.assign.text=You are logged in to the system but are not currently assigned to a company. Contact your company administrator \
  now to be assigned to a company so that you may continue using the system. Once the company administrator confirms that you have been \
  assigned to a company, press the Continue button below. Alternatively, you may log out of the system now and await confirmation of assignment, \
  at which time you may log in again and, if the assignment has been correctly made, you will be taken to the company menu otherwise you will \
  be returned to this screen.
companyUser.assign.button=Continue
companyUser.intro.title=Introduction to the Demonstration System
companyUser.intro.text1=Welcome to our demonstration system. You have arrived at this screen for one of two reasons: Firstly, it could be \
  the first time you have registered with our system (or re-logged in to it) and have not yet created a test company for yourself. Secondly, \
  it could be that you have already created a test company for yourself and have just registered as a new user intending to use that test company. \
  Your options are described further below...
companyUser.subhead2=Creating a New Test Company
companyUser.intro.text2=If you wish to create a test company for yourself, simply fill in the details below and then press the Create button.
companyUser.subhead3=Joining an Existing Test Company
companyUser.intro.text3=If you have registered intending to be a second or subsequent user in a test company that has already been created, you now \
  need to contact the person who created the test company giving them your login id and asking them to assign you to the company. Once they have assigned \
  you to the company, simply press the continue button below. If it was you who created the test company and are creating another user for that \
  company, you can open another browser window to assign this new user to the company before pressing the Continue button on this page.
companyUser.general.helpButtons=Data entry fields have help buttons which give you information on what you are expected to enter. Use these often \
  when first getting accustomed to the system.
companyUser.general.pageHelp=On many pages, if you click the title of the page a pop up window will appear containing more generalized information than the field help buttons \
  described above. This can be useful in getting a broader overview of the area you are working in. Try it on the 'Test Company Created' heading above since this contains \
  IMPORTANT INFORMATION about your browser.
companyUser.general.localization=The system is capable of multilingual operation although all texts were originally written in English (British dialect) \
  and this remains the default language of the system. Which language you see depends upon two things: 1. the country and language selections you made in your \
  user profile (Canadian French versus French French etc) and 2. whether we have texts available within the system for your language.  Data you enter yourself is, \
  of course, retained in your own language although other users with different language settings can simply overtype your version and the system will subsequently \
  display the preferred language version to each user.
companyUser.general.dataEntry=Dates and numbers are entered in your local format as determined by the language and country settings of your user profile. To see the \
  expected formats for entering dates and numbers, press the help button near the top right hand corner of this page, just before your name.
companyUser.general.criteria=On many pages that show lists of data, the system allows you to enter criteria to restrict what is included in the list. This can \
  be extremely helpful when trying to locate a specific item or items out of a long list. Like most systems, we use codes in the database but display a decoded \
  text version in the list. When using the criteria facility of a list page, you need to enter the code rather than what is displayed. Such fields are noted by \
  an asterisk in the criteria selection list. As a hint, most codes are the lower case version of the displayed English text.
companyUser.general.security=The system uses roles for enforcing system security. Menus only show you options you are allowed to use. If your menu consists of \
  nothing other than a User Administration option, then you have not been assigned any roles within the company by the company administrator. The company administrator \
  role allows a user to perform just about any function within the company. Above the company administrator and at the top of the hierarchy is the system \
  administrator. The system administrator is allowed to do anything at all and therefore needs to be a user who is thoroughly familiar with how the system works.
companyUser.general.multicompany=This is a multi-company system and, although you may have created only a single test company, you may be sharing the system with \
  other test companies created by other people. Because of this, performance will vary depending not just on the speed of the Internet/Intranet, but also on \
  the load on our server at any point in time. In a live system, you would be able to create many companies all administered by a single user, if you wished. A \
  single user would also be able to use multiple companies if that was required in the live system. In this demonstration system, however, each login id is \
  associated with a single company. If you wish to have more than one company for testing purposes, please contact your system administrator to set \
  this up for you.
companyUser.general.cleanup=Because this is a demonstration system, any user who has not logged in for 30 days will be deleted. If this means that a test company \
  no longer has any users associated with it, the company will also be deleted. This allows us to keep our system in a tidy state and helps to improve performance.
companyUser.create.title=Test Company Created
companyUser.create.text=Your company has been created and you have been assigned the role of company administrator which will allow you to perform all company \
  related activities. You will not, however, have access to system administrator facilities such as creating new companies, creating or editing roles, logging \
  user activity, tracing database activity and so forth. As a company administrator you do NOT need to be added to data access groups since you have full access \
  to all general ledger, customer and supplier accounts. The company has been given a very basic set of accounts which you are free to modify, but we suggest you \
  start by doing some familiarization tasks such as browsing around the menus and then printing out a chart of accounts, a trial balance and lists of suppliers and customers \
  etc. We have provided below a list of points which may be of use to you when first using the system. You may wish to print this list out for future reference. \
  Once you have read the list, click the Continue button at the bottom of the page to move to your company menu.
companyUser.attach.title=Test Company Access
companyUser.attach.text=You have been granted access to the test company. We have provided below a list of points which may be of use \
  to you when first using the system. You may wish to print this list out for future reference. Once you have read the list, click the Continue button at the \
  bottom of the page to move to your company menu.
companyUser.lastUsed.help=This date and time is set when the company user record is first created and is then automatically \
  updated each time the user connects to this company. The main purpose of this date is to allow the demo system to automatically \
  delete redundant users and so it is doubtful that you should be changing it in any way.

conversion.source.label=Source
conversion.target.label=Target
conversion.target.same.measure=The source and target measures must be the same
conversion.target.different.scale=The source and target scales must be different
conversion.no.conversion=No conversion from {0} to {1} is available
conversion.code.help=The code uniquely identifies this unit of measure conversion within the company. It can be up to 10 characters long, \
  must start with a letter (a-z and A-Z) and can consist of letters, digits (0-9) and underscores.
conversion.name.help=Enter a descriptive name of up to 50 characters for this conversion.
conversion.source.help=Select the source unit to convert from. If you are creating a conversion from, say, inches to \
  centimeters, then you DO NOT need to also create a conversion from centimeters to inches - the system can work conversions \
  both forwards and backwards. For reasons of mathematical accuracy, you may wish to create multiple conversions between one \
  measure/scale combination and another measure/scale combination. For example, creating a conversion between inches and centimeters \
  may become slightly inaccurate when miles are converted to kilometers. Although the inaccuracy is usually insignificant, you could \
  if you wished create a specific miles to kilometers conversion to avoid even this slight inaccuracy. The system will always attempt to \
  pick the most accurate conversion available depending upon the units involved.
conversion.target.help=Select the target unit to convert to. This must be of the same measure (length, weight etc) but a \
  different scale (Imperial/US, Metric etc) than the source unit.
conversion.preAddition.help=Enter any number that should be added to the value being converted before the multiplier is applied. \
  For example, converting from Farenheit to Centigrade would require a pre-addition of -32.
conversion.multiplier.help=Enter the number of target units per source unit. For example if the source unit is inches and the target \
  unit is centimeters then enter 2.54 since one inch is equivalent to 2.54 centimeters. Up to 10 digits are allowed after the decimal separator \
  so that you can use a highly accurate value as your multiplier. The value you enter must be greater than zero.
conversion.postAddition.help=Enter any number that should be added to the value being converted after any pre-addition and the multiplier \
  have been applied. For example, converting from Centigrade to Farenheit would require a post addition of 32.

  enter the value to test against. If you choose 'Is null' or 'Is not null' as the \
  test, do not enter a value. If you choose 'Like' or 'Not like' as the test then \
  you may use a percent sign (%) to represent zero or more characters and an \
  underscore (_) to represent any single character. If you choose 'Between' or \
  'Not between' as the test, enter two values separated by: space, ampersand, \
  space as in: 1 & 99. If you choose 'In' or 'Not in' as the test, you may enter \
  multiple values separated by: space, vertical bar, space as in: A | B | C. Boolean \
  values can either be entered in English (true or false) or as integers (1 or 0). Some \
  fields contain codes which are translated to the values you see. In such cases the fields \
  will be marked with an asterisk (*) and you will need to test against the code value rather than the \
  text you see. Ask your system administrator for code values. Choosing -- none -- in either the \
  property or test selection lists will remove any existing criteria. Press the Apply button to \
  action your changes.

documentType.code.help=Enter a code up to 10 characters long. The code may not contain spaces, colons (:), equals signs \
  (=) or dots (.). It is possible that the code may appear on documents sent to third parties, so try to make the code \
  indicative of its document type (e.g. SI for Sales Invoice etc).
documentType.name.help=Enter a descriptive name for this document type. It is possible that the code may appear on \
  documents sent to third parties. Names can be up to 30 characters long.
documentType.nextSequenceNumber.help=Enter the next sequence number to use when creating documents of this type. \
  WARNING: If you already have documents of this type in the system, reducing this number may cause duplication \
  errors.
documentType.type.help=The 'type' is an internal code used by the programs to identify what sort of document type this is. \
  For example, you may define two types of sales invoice, one with a code of, say, SI (for Sales Invoice) and another with a \
  code of, say, ESI (for Export Sales Invoice). They should both be defined as being of type 'Sales Invoice', however, so \
  that the programs know how to process them. Once you have created a new document type, you can NOT change its type, although \
  you may be able to delete it and re-create it with a different type, if you wish.
documentType.autoGenerate.help=Check this box if you would like the system to automatically generate document 'numbers' for \
  you. Clear the box if you wish to allow users to manually enter the document 'number'. Note that document 'numbers' are \
  actually held as strings and can therefore contain any characters rather than just digits.
documentType.allowEdit.help=Set this flag if the user is intended to enter the document 'number' rather than having the \
  system automatically generate it for them. Note that it is possible to have both the Auto Generate and Allow Edit flags \
  set which can be useful at times but is potentially dangerous since duplicate numbers may be generated.
documentType.autoBankAccount.help=If this document type is to be used for making automatic payments to suppliers, select the bank account \
  from which the payments should be made. Otherwise, leave this field set to none.
documentType.autoForeignCurrency.help=For automatic payment of suppliers, if this box is checked then suppliers can be paid in their \
  account currency even when this is different from the bank account currency. If the box is unchecked then only suppliers whose \
  account is in the same currency as the bank account can be paid via this document type. In the case of payments in 'foreign' currencies \
  (i.e. different from the bank account currency) a separate document is created for each currency involved.
documentType.autoMaxPayees.help=For automatic supplier payments, specify the maximum number of payees that can be included in one document. \
  A value of 1 means that each payment uses its own document. A value of 100 would mean that up to 100 payees can be included in a single \
  document thus, effectively, making the document a 'payment list' such as used in automated bank transfers. Do not make this number too \
  large or the document will become unwieldy and will take a long time to post. If this is not to be an automatic payment document type, \
  leave this field blank.
documentType.autoBankAccount.not.payment=Auto payment details can only be specified for a Bank Payment document type
documentType.autoBankAccount.not.bank=The selected account is not a bank account

incomeReport.element.help=If you wish to limit the report to accounts with a specific value for this code element, select the relevant value from the list.
incomeReport.text=Creating an Income and Expenditure report can be a fairly heavy process and you should consider deferring its execution to a quiet time of day \
  so as not to slow down normal processing. After setting the parameters you require, click the Submit button below to submit the report for execution.
incomeReport.grouping1.label=Grouping 1
incomeReport.grouping1.help=You can break down the figures in the report by a specified Code Element. For example, if you were to select 'line of business' as \
  the primary grouping, then the figures on the report would be sub-totalled by 'line of business'. If you just want the summary figures printing, then set this \
  field to 'none'.
incomeReport.grouping2.label=Grouping 2
incomeReport.grouping2.help=If you chose a Grouping 1 element, then you may break each of the group one values down further by selecting a Grouping 2 \
  code element. For example, if your primary Grouping 1 element was, say, 'line of business' and you chose 'branch' as your Grouping 2 element, then \
  the figures on the report would be broken down primarily by 'line of busness' and then by 'branch' within 'line of business'.
incomeReport.grouping3.label=Grouping 3
incomeReport.grouping3.help=If you selected a Grouping 2 element and wish to break down the values on the report down even further, select the tertiary \
  grouping element here. Otherwise, leave this field set to 'none'.
incomeReport.detailed.label=Detailed Accounts
incomeReport.detailed.help=At the lowest level of grouping selected above, or the Chart Section level if no grouping was specified, you may choose \
  to print the underlying accounts making up the summary values. If you wish to do this, then check this box but be aware that the report could end \
  up being rather large as well as taking longer to process.
incomeReport.groupings=Groupings must be entered in the order Grouping 1, Grouping 2 and then Grouping 3
incomeReport.duplicate=Each grouping selection must be different
incomeReport.mismatch=Cannot limit a report to a specific Code Element Value and have that same Code Element used for grouping

period.validTo.high=The Valid To date cannot be after the end of the year
period.code.help=Enter a short code of up to 10 characters in length that describes this accounting period. Since users \
  will be shown lists of valid periods sorted by their codes, it is a good idea to make the period codes pseudo-numeric. \
  For example, March 2010 might be given a code such as '2010-03'. Alternatively, you may choose to number periods within the \
  accounting year to which they belong so, for example, an accounting year ending at the end of June 2010 might use a code \
  of '2010-09' for the period covering March 2010 (where '2010-01' would represent July 2009).

period.open=Open New Accounting Period
period.to.open=The accounting period to be opened is {0}. Because opening a new period can be a lengthy process, it will \
  be executed as a background task and you should consider deferring its execution to a quiet time of day so as not to slow \
  down normal processing. To submit the task for execution, click the Submit button below.
period.no.open=No period is available to open. This may be because you have no periods defined or because opening a new \
  period would leave more than two accounting years open at the same time.

  are selecting which report format to run. The name can be up to thirty characters long and must be unique within your company.
profitReportFormat.title.help=Enter the title that should appear on the report. This may be up to thirty characters long and can \
  contain special 'place holders' as follows: {sPd} will be replaced by the code of the period the user selects to run the report for; \
  {sYr} will be replaced by the code of the year to which the selected period belongs; {cPd} will be replaced by the code of the comparative \
  period (i.e. the same period as the selected period, but in the preceding year) and {cYr} will be replaced by the code of the comparative \
  year (i.e. the year containing the comparative period). Include the curly braces and remember that the place holders are case sensitive.
profitReportFormat.subTitle.help=You may optionally enter a Sub-Title for the report of up to thirty characters in length. Any Sub-Title \
  you enter will be printed under the report Title. You may use the same 'place-holders' as for the Title.
profitReportFormat.column1Heading.help=Enter the heading that is to appear over this column of the report. This may be up to ten characters long \

  period (i.e. the same period as the selected period, but in the preceding year) and {cYr} will be replaced by the code of the comparative \
  year (i.e. the year containing the comparative period). Include the curly braces and remember that the place holders are case sensitive.
profitReportFormat.column1SubHeading.help=You may optionally supply a Sub-Heading of up to ten characters for a column. Any Sub-Heading you \
  enter will be printed below the relevant Heading. You may use the same 'place-holders' in the Sub-Heading as for the Heading.
profitReportFormat.column1PrimaryData.help=Select the data that you wish to display in this column of the report, or wish to include in a calculation \
  to determine the values to be displayed. If you do not wish to display any data in this column, choose 'none'. The selections available consist of the \
  combination of three component parts: Selected or Comparative; Period or Year-To-Date and Actuals (with or without adjustments) or Budgets. \
  The 'Selected' options refer to the year and period that the user chooses to run the report for whereas the 'Comparative' options refer to the \
  year prior to the selected year plus the equivalent period within that year. 'Period' options refer to values for the specific period whereas \
  'Year-To-Date' options refer to the cumulative values up to and including the specific period. The 'Actuals' options refer to the actual posted \
  values (either including or excluding transactions that were flagged as being adjustments when they were posted) whereas the 'Budgets' options \
  refer to the budget values that you have entered in to the system.
profitReportFormat.column1Calculation.help=If you select 'none' then the data displayed in this column of the report will simply be that selected \
  as the Primary Data for this column. If you select Difference as the calculation for this column then the Secondary Data value will be subtracted \
  from the Primary Data value and the resulting monetary amount will be the value displayed in this column (typically used for displaying the monetary \
  difference between actuals and budgets). Selecting Variance as the calculation will subtract the Secondary Data value from the Primary Data Value \
  and then express the result as a percentage of the Secondary Data value (typically used for displaying the variance percentage between actuals and \
  budgets). Selecting Total Percentage as the calculation will lead to the Primary Data value being expressed as a percentage of the Chart Section(s) \
  identified as forming the Total involved. Typically, the Chart Section(s) representing Sales would be selected as the Total to use so that setting \
  this column's Calculation to Total Percentage would lead to the percentage of Sales (including gross profit percentage) being displayed here. By \
  convention, such percentages are always shown in absolute form (i.e. always as positives), unlike variances.
profitReportFormat.column1SecondaryData.help=If you chose 'none' or Total Percentage as the Calculation type, then leave this field set to 'none'. \
  If you chose Difference or Variance as the Calculation type, specify the secondary data that is to be subtracted from the Primary Data.

recurring.reference.help=Enter a reference of up to 24 characters that uniquely identifies this recurring transaction within the chosen bank account. \
  The text you enter here will be suffixed by '/n' when postings are performed. For example, if you enter a reference of ABC123 then the document created \
  for the first payment/receipt will have a reference of ABC123/1, the second payment/receipt document a reference of ABC123/2 and so forth.
recurring.description.help=Optionally enter a description of up to 50 characters to describe the purpose of this recurring transaction.
recurring.totalTransactions.help=Enter the total number of transactions to be processed. Include any initial and final transactions in the count. For \
  example, if you were paying a monthly standing order for a year, you would enter 12 here. If you leave this field blank, it will be taken to mean that \
  the payments or receipts are to continue indefinitely until this record is deleted.
recurring.initialDate.help=If the first payment or receipt covered by this definition is on a different date than all other transactions, enter the date \
  of the initial payment or receipt here. For example, if a monthly direct debit has its first payment on the 17th February but thereafter the payments \
  are on the 25th of the month, you would enter the 17th of February of the appropriate year as the Initial Date. If you leave this field blank, the \
  first payment or receipt will be made on the Recurs From date. To see the format you should enter dates in, click the help button at the top right hand \
  side of this page.
recurring.initialValue.help=If the first amount paid/received is different from all subsequent amounts, enter the initial amount here. This feature is \
  independent of the Initial Date feature in so far as you can specify an Initial Value without specifying an Initial Date. In such a case the Initial \
  Value will be paid/received on the Recurs From date. If the first payment/receipt is the same as the others, leave this field blank.
recurring.recursFrom.help=Enter the date that the payments or receipts begin to recur. To see the format you should enter dates in, click the help button \
  at the top right hand side of this page.
recurring.recurrenceType.help=Select the basis by which the transactions will recur.
recurring.recurrenceInterval.help=Enter the recurrence interval. For example, if you wanted the payments/receipts to recur every other week then choose Weekly \
  as the Recurrence Type and enter 2 as the interval. Similarly, if you wanted the payments/receipts to recur every month then choose Monthly as the \
  Recurrence Type and enter 1 here. Quarterly would be a Recurrence Type of Monthly and an interval of 3, and so forth.
recurring.lastDayOfMonth.help=If the Recurrence Type is not Monthly or the Recurs From date is not the last day of a month, leave this flag clear. If the date \
  you entered IS the last day of a month, you should check this box if all recurring payments are also to be on the last day of the month. For example, if you \
  entered a Recurs From date of the 30th April and checked this box, the payments/receipts would be made on the last day of each appropriate month. If you had \
  NOT checked this box, however, the payments/receipts would be made on the 30th of each relevant month (or 28th/29th of February if applicable).
recurring.recurringValue.help=Enter the amount of an individual recurring payment/receipt.
recurring.finalValue.help=If the last payment or receipt amount is different from the normal recurring amounts, enter the last value here. If the last value is \
  the same as the recurring amounts leave this field blank.
recurring.account.help=Select the bank account from which the payments/receipts are to be made.
recurring.autoAllocate.help=If the line by line analysis of this recurring transaction includes postings to Customer or Supplier accounts and you \
  would like the system to perform an automatic allocation on those accounts, check this box. If you would NOT like an automatic allocation performing \
  then un-check this box. If no Customer or Supplier account postings are involved, the setting of this flag is ignored.
recurring.currency.help=Select the currency that the payment/receipt is to be made in. All values entered in this recurring bank transaction definition \
  should be entered in the currency you select here.
recurring.type.help=Select the specific document type to use. Your selection determines whether this recurring bank transaction represents payments or receipts.

recurring.recurring.final=The Recurring Value does not match the total of the posting analysis Final column
recurring.totalTransactions.low=The total transactions cannot be less than the current processed count
recurring.nextDue.help=This field shows the date that the next payment or receipt is due. You may not edit this field but other changes you make may \
  cause the system to change it automatically. If the transaction cannot be processed on this date, it will be 'caught up' as soon as possible. Postings \
  are made in to the period that covers this date unless that period is closed, in which case it will be posted to the first available period after that.
recurring.processedCount.help=This field shows the number of transactions posted from this definition. You may not edit it. If a posting fails for any \
  reason, the owner of the task that performs recurring transaction processing will be notified by email of the problem so that it can be resolved.

  taxation purposes. If you need to record the goods value of purchases from this supplier even when no tax is involved \
  (such as purchases from a non-registered supplier in a VAT style system) you may wish to create a tax code of 'untaxed' \
  with a zero rate and then give this supplier the 'untaxed' status to ensure that the goods value of purchases from them \

systemAddressFormat.name.help=Enter a name of up to 30 characters that describes the purpose of this address format.
systemAddressFormat.field.help=Select the field to be entered by/displayed to the user. Do not leave blank lines between field definitions. \
  You must include all of the Company, Contact, Identifier and Country placeholder fields that MAY be included when an address is displayed, \
  but which are NOT entered by the user as part of the address. The user will see/enter address fields in the order you specify them here, but \
  are stored in the database (excluding the placeholder fields) by the field you select. For placeholder fields, any other data you specify for \
  the line will be ignored.
systemAddressFormat.prompt.help=You may select up to three prompts per field. The prompts are placed at the side of the data entry area when the \
  user is entering an address. Multiple prompts will be separated by slash marks (/) as in State/Province/Region etc.
systemAddressFormat.width.help=Enter the width of the data entry area for when the user is entering an address. Display widths can be from 1 to 50. \
  Display widths DO NOT limit the amount of data the user can enter (see the Pattern help for that), but merely alter the width of the area they can \
  enter data in to. The display width of a field can be a useful hint to a user as to what sort of data is expected. For example, setting a State data \
  entry area to be two characters wide gives a user a good hint that the State code (e.g. CA) is expected rather than the full name of the State (e.g. \
  California).
systemAddressFormat.joinBy.help=When an address is formatted for display, you may wish for some of the fields to appear together on a single line \
  rather than on separate lines as they were entered by the user. To place the current field on the same line as the preceding field when the address \
  is displayed, enter a value in the current line's Join By field. Do not use spaces in the Join By field, but rather underscores (_) which will be \
  translated to spaces when the address is displayed. To join a field to the previous field without ANY intervening characters, set the Join By field \
  to a single vertical bar character (|). The single vertical bar will be omitted when the fields are concatenated. Any other characters in the Join By \
  field will be taken literally. When the address is constructed for display, if the preceding line is blank the Join by Characters will be omitted. The \
  Join By information you enter, if any, can be up to 20 characters long.
systemAddressFormat.mandatory.help=Check this box if the user must enter a value for this field.
systemAddressFormat.pattern.help=The system uses regular expressions (also called regex) to validate the data the user enters. If you wish to validate \
  the data the user enters in this way, enter a regular exression of up to 100 characters as the pattern. For example, entering a pattern of [A-Z][A-Z] \
  will require the user to enter two (and only two) upper case Latin letters, as often used for State abbreviations. To find out more about regular \
  expressions, search the Internet for regex.

systemConversion.target.same.measure=The source and target measures must be the same
systemConversion.target.different.scale=The source and target scales must be different
systemConversion.code.help=The code uniquely identifies this unit of measure conversion within the system. It can be up to 10 characters long, \
  must start with a letter (a-z and A-Z) and can consist of letters, digits (0-9) and underscores.
systemConversion.name.help=Enter a descriptive name of up to 50 characters for this conversion.
systemConversion.source.help=Select the source unit to convert from. If you are creating a conversion from, say, inches to \
  centimeters, then you DO NOT need to also create a conversion from centimeters to inches - the system can work conversions \
  both forwards and backwards. For reasons of mathematical accuracy, you may wish to create multiple conversions between one \
  measure/scale combination and another measure/scale combination. For example, creating a conversion between inches and centimeters \
  may become slightly inaccurate when miles are converted to kilometers. Although the inaccuracy is usually insignificant, you could \
  if you wish create a specific miles to kilometers conversion to avoid even this slight inaccuracy. The system will always attempt to \
  pick the most accurate conversion available depending upon the units involved.
systemConversion.target.help=Select the target unit to convert to. This must be of the same measure (length, weight etc) but a \
  different scale (Imperial/US, Metric etc) than the source unit.
systemConversion.preAddition.help=Enter any number that should be added to the value being converted before the multiplier is applied. \
  For example, converting from Farenheit to Centigrade would require a pre-addition of -32.
systemConversion.multiplier.help=Enter the number of target units per source unit. For example if the source unit is inches and the target \
  unit is centimeters then enter 2.54 since one inch is equivalent to 2.54 centimeters. Up to 10 digits are allowed after the decimal separator \
  so that you can use a highly accurate value as your multiplier. The value you enter must be greater than zero.
systemConversion.postAddition.help=Enter any number that should be added to the value being converted after any pre-addition and the multiplier \
  have been applied. For example, converting from Centigrade to Farenheit would require a post addition of 32.

systemMenu.update.type=Cannot alter type from sub-menu when there are child records
systemMenu.delete.confirm=If this is a sub-menu, the children will be deleted also. Are you sure?
systemMenu.path.help=The data you enter here determines where in the hierarchy of menu \
  options this option will appear. If you enter a value such as 'accounts', then \
  you are specifying an option of the main menu. A path such as 'accounts.inventory' \
  specifies that the option is to be displayed in the sub-menu with the path of \
  'accounts'. The 'accounts' path record must already exist. Changing the path \
  of an existing record will reposition it (and its children if it is a sub-menu) \
  within the menu hierarchy. NOTE however, that any changes to the internationalization \
  texts of your system have to be done manually. Also note that only letters, \
  digits and the dot (.) conjunction character are allowed within a path definition. \
  A path can be up to nine levels deep and has an overall limit of 100 characters.
systemMenu.title.help=This is the text that will be displayed for the option when it is \
  shown in a menu.
systemMenu.sequencer.help=The number you enter here determines where, within the menu \

  will be displayed. We suggest that you leave gaps between option sequencer numbers \
  (e.g. 10, 20, 30 rather than 1, 2, 3) to accommodate later option insertions. It \
  is possible to have duplicate sequencer numbers within a particular menu path, \
  but this rather defeats the object! Sequence numbers can range from 0 to 999999.
systemMenu.type.help=Choose the type of option this record represents.
systemMenu.command.help=For a controller and action option type, enter the controller and \
  action separated by a dot, as in: inventory.list. For a sub-menu option type, \
  leave this field blank. For an external URL option type, enter the full URL that \
  you would like the option to go to (e.g. http://www.google.com). For an operating \
  system program, enter the program name and, where required, its file suffix \
  (e.g. my_program.exe). Depending upon how your operating system is set up, you \
  may need to type in the full path of the program (e.g. c:\\development\\my_program.exe). \
  You may also be able to put 'command line' parameters after the program name \
  (e.g. myprogram -nodump) etc.
systemMenu.parameters.help=For a controller and action option type, enter any parameters \
  you wish to pass. Parameters are entered as a comma separated list of pairs. For \
  example: sort:itemCode, max:50. This will pass two parameters to the target \
  controller.action, one called 'sort' with a value of 'itemCode' and the other \
  called 'max' with a value of '50'. For an external URL option type, enter any \
  parameters you would like to pass to the URL. This will be passed after the URL \
  using '?sort=itemCode&max=50' etc. For an operating system program, enter the \
  environment variables you would like to pass to the program. The program will \
  'see' the variables as sort=itemCode and max=50 etc. Note that if you include \
  a parameter with the name 'dir_' then its value will be taken to be the directory \
  that should be changed to before the program is executed. For a sub-menu option \
  type, enter text that should be displayed at the top of the page when this sub-menu \
  is displayed. If you leave this field blank, the the option's title will be \
  used as the menu title.
systemMenu.activity.help=Select the activity that this menu option is a part of for \

systemUser.securityAnswer.help=The answer to the security question allows the system to have reasonable confidence that \
  you are who you say you are before it assigns you a new password and emails it to you. A security answer is treated as \
  case insensitive and is usually (but does not have to be) a single word.

  account which is not for interactive use (but may be used for running reports etc).
systemUser.nextPasswordChange.help=The system obliges a user to change their password at certain intervals, or when they \
  have forgotten their password and request a new one. You may also enforce a password change manually (the next time they log in) by entering a date \
  and time here.

task.executable.no.instance=Unable to instantiate the executable
task.activity.no.activity=An on demand task must have an activity defined
task.user.no.user=A scheduled task must have an owing user defined
task.code.help=Task codes uniquely identify a particular task definition within the company and may be up to 10 \
  characters long. A code must start with a letter and can contain letters (A-Z and a-z), digits (0-9) and underscores.
task.name.help=Enter a descriptive name, up to 50 characters long, for this task definition.
task.executable.help=This is the name of the program to be executed. There are a fixed number of programs available. \
  If you do not know what these are, please contact the system supervisor.
task.allowOnDemand.help=Check this box if you would like end users to be able to run this task manually. Leaving this \
  box unchecked implies that this will be a scheduled run, executed automatically at intervals. A task can be both \
  scheduled and available for manual execution. If it is neither scheduled nor available on demand, then the task is \
  effectively disabled.
task.schedule.help=If this task is to be executed automatically at scheduled intervals, you need to enter the schedule \
  here. The schedule takes the form of a 'crontab' entry from the Unix 'cron' system. For example, '15 3 * * *' means \
  run at 3:15 AM every day. If you are not sure how to specify crontab entries, contact the system supervisor. NOTE \
  that the schedule is relative to the time on the server, which may be in a different time zone from you.
task.nextScheduledRun.help=For a non-scheduled run, leave this field blank. For a scheduled run, you need to specify the \
  time that the next run is to take place. This 'gets the ball rolling' after which the scheduler will take over the \
  job of scheduling following runs. The facility to edit this field also allows you to perform an intermediate run or \
  to skip a run if you wish. Enter a date and time in your local format (click on the help button near the top right hand \
  corner of the page to see your local formats) when the next run should be made. Leaving this field blank means that the \
  schedule is not to be started yet. NOTE that any date and time you enter will be relative to the server, which may be \
  in a different time zone from you.
task.activity.help=For a run that cannot be executed on demand, you may leave this field blank. For a task that can be \
  executed on demand, you need to specify the activity that a user must possess (by virtue of the roles assigned to them) \
  in order to execute this task on demand. If you are unsure of what the activities are, or which roles contain which \
  activities, contact the system supervisor.
task.user.help=For a non-scheduled run you may leave this field blank. For a scheduled run, you need to specify the user \
  in whose name the task will be executed. This is typically the company administrator (yourself!).
task.retentionDays.help=Enter the number of days that a completed task will remain in the task queue for inspection. \
  Note that some tasks may use their preceding run's results to alter the job they perform and so the retention days must \
  allow for the intervals between such runs.
task.systemOnly.help=Used only for the System company. When checked, specifies that new companies should not receive a \
  copy of this task definition.
task.propagate.help=If you click the propagate button for a task then any changes you have made to the definition will be \
  copied to all the other companies (including the System company if you are currently in some other company). Task definitions \
  flagged as being System Only or that require the sysadmin activity to run cannot be propagated. New Scheduled tasks will \
  only be propagated to companies that have a Company Administrator user defined. If you have changed the code of a task, it \
  will be seen as a NEW task.
task.propagated={0} company/companies updated

translation.fromLanguage.help=Leave this selection set to none if you want the system to find the 'best fit' for texts to \
  be translated. Otherwise, select the language to translate from. Selecting a language to translate from is usually \
  only useful when you are translating to a dialect (e.g. Angolan Portuguese) from another dialect of the same language \
  (e.g. Brazilian Portuguese) which you know has already been translated and is closer to your chosen dialect than the \
  standard version of the language (e.g. Portuguese as spoken in Portugal).
translation.fromCountry.help=You rarely need to select a 'From Country'. One example of where it might be useful is when you \
  wish to translate to, say, Peruvian Spanish and you know that a translation has already been done to Columbian Spanish AND \
  that Columbian Spanish is closer to Peruvian Spanish than the Spanish spoken in Spain (which has also been translated already).
translation.toLanguage.help=You must select the language you are translating to.
translation.toCountry.help=If you are translating to a 'standard' version of a language (e.g. Italian as spoken in Italy, \
  Chinese as spoken in China etc.) then it is better to leave the 'To Country' set to none. Only if you are translating to a \
  dialect of a language (e.g. Latvian Russian) should you select the country of the dialect.
translation.strict.help=The system will normally attempt to find the best version of a text for you to translate \
  by using a hierarchical approach using first the From language and country (if country has been specified), then just the From \
  language and, finally, the default locale. Check this box if you would like to stop this hierarchical search and only show you \
  the messages for your specific settings of From language and country.
translation.display.help=Select what you wish to display in the list of items to translate. You can choose between \
  displaying only items that you have already translated (for correction purposes, perhaps), items that are still \
  untranslated or both translated and untranslated items.
translation.translation.help=Enter the new text of your translation. Texts can be between 1 and 2000 characters in length.
translation.fromCountry.no.fromLanguage=You cannot specify a 'From Country' without specifying a 'From Language'
translation.toCountry.no.toLanguage=You cannot specify a 'To Country' without specifying a 'To Language'
translation.toLanguage.no.translation=The language and country combination must be different for the 'From' and 'To' selectors
translation.toLanguage.is.null=You must select a language to translate to
translation.dependent.error=Error saving a dependent record. The message was: {0}
translation.deletion.warning=If you have the Propagate check box checked, this will also delete other records in the same locale \
  as this one and that also have the same text. NOTE that, in no instance, will the deletion(s) affect the underlying records for \
  the default locale and, if applicable, any language-only locale. Are you sure?
translation.propagate.label=Propagate
translation.propagate.help=Check this box if you would like to make the same change to other messages, if any, in the locale \
  you are translating to and that would display the same text. Uncheck this box to affect just this one message.

# Unit domain messages
unit.label=Unit
unit.code.label=Code
unit.name.label=Name
unit.multiplier.label=Multiplier
unit.measure.label=Measure
unit.scale.label=Scale
unit.conversions.label=Conversions
unit.convertees.label=Convertees
unit.code.help=The code uniquely identifies this unit of measure within the company. It can be up to 10 characters long, \
  must start with a letter (a-z and A-Z) and can consist of letters, digits (0-9), underscores, parentheses and dots.
unit.name.help=Enter a descriptive name of up to 30 characters for this unit.
unit.multiplier.help=The multiplier is the number you need to multiply the base unit of the same measure and scale by to get \
  one of these units. A base unit for a measure/scale combination is a unit with a multiplier of 1. For example, if the base unit of \
  the length/metric combination is centimeters, and you are creating the metre unit, then the multiplier for the metre unit would be 100 \
  since there are 100 centimeters in a metre.
unit.measure.help=Select the measure to which this unit belongs.
unit.scale.help=Select the scale to which this unit belongs.

# Year domain messages
year.label=Year
year.code.label=Code
year.validFrom.label=Valid From
year.validTo.label=Valid To
year.company.label=Company
year.periods.label=Periods
year.validFrom.mismatch=The Valid From date cannot be greater than the Valid To date
year.validFrom.bad=The Valid From date is invalid
year.validTo.bad=The Valid To date is invalid
year.code.help=Enter a short code of up to 10 characters by which this accounting year will be known. Typically this \
  would be the calendar year in which the account year ends (e.g. for a year ending on the last day of June 2010, give \
  it a code such as: 2010). Since accounting years need not actually be one calendar year long (they may be more or \
  less than a calendar year) it sometimes happens that two accounting years end within the same calendar year. In such \
  cases you might give the second accounting year a name such as: 2010.2. Year codes may appear on reports.
year.validFrom.help=Enter the first day of this accounting year. If there are previous accounting years then this date \
  should be the day after the preceding accounting year ended. To see the format you should enter dates in, click the \
  help button at the top right hand side of this page.
year.validTo.help=Enter the last day of this accounting year. To see the format you should enter dates in, click the \
  help button at the top right hand side of this page.
year.delete.gap=Deleting this year would leave a gap in the date ranges.
year.consecutive=The Valid From date must be one day after the preceding year's Valid To date
year.next=The Valid To date must be one day before the following year's Valid From date
year.bad.first.pd=The new Valid From date would invalidate the first period of the year
year.err.first.pd=Unable to change the start date of the first period of the year
year.bad.last.pd=The new Valid To date would invalidate the last period of the year
year.err.last.pd=Unable to change the end date of the last period of the year
year.no.new=You may not create a new year until all periods of the preceding year have been defined.
year.delete.status=You may not delete a year if any of its periods are open
year.delete.trans=An error occurred deleting the transactions thus leaving the year in an inconsistent state. \
  Contact your system administrator immediately.
year.confirm=Confirm Year Deletion
year.confirm.text=Year {0} has transactions associated with it and therefore could take a while to delete. Consequently \
  it will be executed as a background task so that you may continue working on other things. You may choose to defer \
  execution of the task to a quiet time of day so as not to slow down normal processing.
year.delete.unallocated=You may only delete a year when all of its customer and supplier transactions are fully allocated
